#### I have 12+ years of electrical experience, and have used computers for 3.5 decades.

My goals for the Data Analytics course:
* Fill in my knowledge gaps for a Data Analyst role
* Have a certificate to bolster my resume
* Gain confidence with Python
* Gain confidence in normal Data Analyst activities
